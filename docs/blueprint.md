## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#306754) to represent environmental sustainability.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a very desaturated shade of yellow. This is in keeping with an analogous color scheme of greens, but makes the green hues seem more lush by comparison. Choosing this as the background in particular conveys earthiness.
- Accent color: A slightly lighter yellow-green (#8F9779) that brings attention in call-to-action spots, and balances the layout.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable design.
- Use eco-friendly icons related to recycling and waste management.
- Clean and organized page layouts for easy navigation.
- Subtle transitions between pages for a smooth user experience.
